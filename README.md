# Crowd Funding Application for Code Hub - Learn
CodeHub Project #team5

Recently refactored .NET application to use PostgreSQL instead of MSSQL for deployment purposes.

 - .NET container deployed on Heroku
 - PostgreSQL (Tiny Turtle version) hosted on ElephantSQL.com
 - Base64 image encoding/decoding and saving/retrieving to database, because of limitations in data persistency in deployment
