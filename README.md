# Crowd Funding Application for Code Hub - Learn
CodeHub Project #team5

Recently refactored .NET application to use PostgreSQL instead of MSSQL for deployment purposes.

 - .NET container deployed on Heroku
 - PostgreSQL (Tiny Turtle version) hosted on ElephantSQL.com

Project images may not show up correctly at the time due to configuration drift between localhost and deployed server.
